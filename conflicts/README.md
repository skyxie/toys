Intersecting Time Segments
===

Coding interview problem to demonstrate that the candidate has some basic problem solving skills without delving into obscure syntax or trivia.

Assume youâ€™re working on a calendar application. One of the useful features of a calendar application is to show the conflicting time periods between different time segments. Write a function that takes as input a list of time segments, where each time segment has a start and an end, and outputs a list of time segments that represents the conflict between any two or more time segments.

For the sake of simplicity we can assume that each time segment is valid - i.e. the start time comes before the end time, and each time segment can be represented as a simple 2 element array of integer time stamps.
